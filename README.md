# Disney Dataset Creation & Analysis

In this project I scrape Wikipedia pages to create a dataset on Disney movies. This project cover a wide range of Python & data science topics. They include:
Web scraping with BeautifulSoup. <br />
Cleaning data. <br />
Testing code with Pytest. <br />
Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library). <br />
Working with dates (datetime library). <br />
Saving & loading data with Pickle library. <br />
Accessing data from an API using Requests library. <br />

# Save/Load the Datasets
If you want to jump into a specific task, feel free to utilize the [dataset checkpoints](https://github.com/Mariam-Fathi/disney-data-science/tree/main/dataset_checkpoints). <br />
To load these files you can look at the functions found [in this file](https://github.com/Mariam-Fathi/disney-data-science/blob/main/helper/save_and_load_dataset_checkpoints.py). <br />
If you want to just do analysis on the final dataset, check out [this folder](https://github.com/Mariam-Fathi/disney-data-science/tree/main/dataset). <br />
